# Example of a basic experiment configuration file.
# ==============================================================================

# most basic configuration to run an example, and demonstrate the use of hydra. 

# 1. 
# First, we notice the directive at line 1 which tells hydra
# to interpret configs in this file at the top level of the config.
# This needs to be done at the first line of the file.

# 2. 
# all we need to do is instantiate the driver which runs the experiment. We specify the 
# path to the driver in the source code, and the settings.
driver: 
  _target_: src.driver.example.BasicExample
  setting1: 'Hello'
  setting2: 'World'

# now to run the experiment, you just need to tell hydra to add this file to the config:
# python main.py experiment=examples/basic.yaml
